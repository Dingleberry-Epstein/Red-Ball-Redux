# Sonic-Pygame-Test
This is a simple attempt at making a working Sonic game using Pygame. I've tried getting angled movement to work but it's actually quite troublesome. The angles do work to some extent but it is incredibly buggy at the moment. Please remember that this is a school project so it will not be the most polished game out there and may be quite short when finished.
